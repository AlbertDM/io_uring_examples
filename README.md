Some examples for io_uring library


## What is io_uring?

`io_uring` is an asynchronous I/O interface for the Linux kernel. An io_uring is a pair of ring buffers in shared memory that are used as queues between user space and the kernel:

* Submission queue (SQ): A user space process uses the submission queue to send asynchronous I/O requests to the kernel.
* Completion queue (CQ): The kernel uses the completion queue to send the results of asynchronous I/O operations back to user space.

## Usecases

`io_uring` can be used for various asynchronous I/O operations. Here are some examples of how you can utilize `io_uring` in a C application:

1. Network Operations: `io_uring` can be used for non-blocking network operations such as reading from and writing to sockets. You can use `io_uring` to handle multiple network connections efficiently by performing I/O operations asynchronously without blocking the execution of your program.

2. File I/O: `io_uring` can be used for asynchronous file I/O operations. This includes reading from and writing to files without blocking the program's execution. Asynchronous file I/O can be useful in scenarios where you want to overlap file operations with other tasks to improve overall performance.

3. Database Operations: If your application interacts with a database, `io_uring` can be used to perform asynchronous database queries or updates. This allows your application to continue processing other tasks while waiting for the database operations to complete.

4. Interacting with External APIs: `io_uring` can be used to interact with external APIs that provide asynchronous interfaces. For example, you can use `io_uring` to send HTTP requests to a web server asynchronously, allowing your application to continue executing other tasks while waiting for the response.

5. Multithreaded Applications: `io_uring` can be beneficial in multithreaded applications where multiple threads can submit I/O operations to the same `io_uring` instance. This can help coordinate and manage concurrent I/O operations efficiently.

The flexibility of `io_uring` makes it suitable for various scenarios where you want to perform I/O operations asynchronously, allowing your application to achieve better performance and responsiveness. The specific use case will depend on the requirements of your application.
